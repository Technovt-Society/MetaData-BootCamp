## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to replicate or enhance human intellect, such as reasoning and learning from experience. Artificial intelligence has been used in computer programs for years, but it is now applied to many other products and services. For example, some digital cameras can determine what objects are present in an image using artificial intelligence software. In addition, experts predict many more innovative uses for artificial intelligence in the future, including smart electric grids.

AI uses techniques from probability theory, economics, and algorithm design to solve practical problems. In addition, the AI field draws upon computer science, mathematics, psychology, and linguistics. Computer science provides tools for designing and building algorithms, while mathematics offers tools for modeling and solving the resulting optimization problems.

Although the concept of AI has been around since the 19th century, when Alan Turing first proposed an “imitation game” to assess machine intelligence, it only became feasible to achieve in recent decades due to the increased availability of computing power and data to train AI systems.

To understand the idea behind AI, you should think about what distinguishes human intelligence from that of other creatures – our ability to learn from experiences and apply these lessons to new situations. We can do this because of our advanced brainpower; we have more neurons than any animal species.

Today’s computers don’t match the human biological neural network – not even close. But they have one significant advantage over us: their ability to analyze vast amounts of data and experiences much faster than humans could ever hope.

AI lets you focus on the most critical tasks and make better decisions based on acquired data related to a use case. It can be used for complex tasks, such as predicting maintenance requirements, detecting credit card fraud, and finding the best route for a delivery truck. In other words, AI can automate many business processes leaving you to concentrate on your core business.

Research in the field is concerned with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior. Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions, handwriting, natural language processing and perception, speech recognition, and the ability to move and manipulate objects.

## Introduction to Data Science

So, for data science which language is required. Here are the top nine programming languages that data scientists should know: 

1. Python
Python is a general-purpose programming language that can get used to develop any software. It is among the top programming languages for data science. Python is known for its simple syntax, easy readability, and code portability. It's also open-source and runs on all major platforms, making it popular among developers. Python is easy to learn and has a large community of developers behind it, so there are plenty of resources to help you get started. It's also powerful enough to be used by professional data scientists. Python is a fantastic language for new programmers since it employs a simple English language and provides a variety of data structures. In addition, it is a machine-level language with a great public reputation. This language is the best option if a student is entering the field as a fresher in the company. 

2. SQL (Structured Query Language)
SQL is one of the world's most widely used programming languages. It is a declarative language for interacting with databases and allows you to create queries to extract information from your data sets. SQL is used in almost every industry, so it's a good idea to learn it early in your data science journey. SQL commands can get executed interactively from a terminal window or through embedded scripts in other software programs such as web browsers or word processors. Structured Query is a programming language used in data science that is specified to the domain. SQL in data science helps users collect data from the databases and later edit them if the situation demands it. Therefore, a student who wants to work as a data scientist must understand Structured Query Language and databases well. If one wants to excel in data science through SQL, one can consider online courses to become a professional data scientist.

3. R is a statistical programming language commonly used for statistical analysis, data visualization, and other forms of data manipulation. R has become increasingly popular among data scientists because of its ease of use and flexibility in handling complex analyses on large datasets. In addition, R language data science offers many packages for machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, k-nearest neighbour algorithm, random forest, neural networks, etc., making it a popular choice for many businesses looking to implement predictive analytics solutions into their business processes. For example, thousands of packages are available today for R, allowing you to analyze financial markets and easily forecast weather patterns! 

4. Julia 
Julia is an important language for data science that aims to be simple yet powerful, with a syntax similar to MATLAB or R. Julia also has an interactive shell that allows users to test code quickly without having to write entire programs simultaneously. In addition, it's fast and memory-efficient, making it well suited for large-scale datasets. This makes coding much faster and more intuitive since it allows you to focus on the problem without worrying about type declarations. 

5. JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language used to develop web applications and websites. It has since become the most popular language for building client-side applications online. JavaScript is also known for its versatility, as it can get used for anything from simple animations to complex artificial intelligence applications. Keep reading to know more about the data science coding languages. 

6. Scala 
Scala has become one of the most popular languages for AI and data science use cases. Because it is statically typed and object-oriented, Scala has often been considered a hybrid language used for data science between object-oriented languages like Java and functional ones like Haskell or Lisp. In addition, Scala has many features that make it an attractive choice for data scientists, including functional programming, concurrency, and high performance. 

7. Java
Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. As a result, Java is the best coding language for data science. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support the Java virtual machine (JVM) or JavaScript engines. However, code that uses platform-dependent capabilities may not run on all JVMs because they are not required to implement those features. All these data science coding languages are important to becoming a data scientist.

8. Go
Go is a programming language data science which is also referred to as GoLang. This programming language is gaining fame slowly and comes in handy in projects related to machine learning. It came out in 2009 when Google introduced it to the world. With a syntax quite similar to C language, people call this the next step in the hierarchy of C language. Go being a middle-level language helps users operate with ease. It is quite the flexible type, and within ten years since its release, it is rapidly coming into the light. When it comes to Data Science, this programming language helps massively in ML operations. However, because of the lack of usage, its reach boundaries are still very tiny compared to Java and Python.

9. MATLAB 
MATLAB is a high-level language and interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming. There are many languages required for data science. MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting functions, and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and extension of existing software. It makes MATLAB useful for developing applications that analyze large amounts of data. The name "MATLAB" is an abbreviation for matrix laboratory. 

10. C/C++
C/C++ is a general-purpose programming languages data science used to develop computer applications. It is a low-level language used for high-performance applications like games, web browsers, and operating systems. C/C++ is also used for numerical computations, in addition to its widespread use in application development. 

The best coding language for data science allows you to work with large volumes of data quickly and efficiently. They should also be easy to use and have a wide range of features that support the entire data science workflow, from exploration to modeling and visualization. Programming language is the most important for data science. Coding creates analytical models and algorithms that allow them to solve complex problems. 

## Why Python?

1. It’s Flexible
If you want to try something creative that’s never done before; then Python is perfect for you. It’s ideal for developers who want to script applications and websites.

2. It’s Easy to Learn
Thanks to Python’s focus on simplicity and readability, it boasts a gradual and relatively low learning curve. This ease of learning makes Python an ideal tool for beginning programmers. Python offers programmers the advantage of using fewer lines of code to accomplish tasks than one needs when using older languages. In other words, you spend more time playing with it and less time dealing with code. 
It’s Open Source
Python is open-source, which means it’s free and uses a community-based model for development. Python is designed to run on Windows and Linux environments. Also, it can easily be ported to multiple platforms. There are many open-source Python libraries such as Data manipulation, Data Visualization, Statistics, Mathematics, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing, to name just a few (though see below for more about this).

3. It’s Well-Supported
Anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and if you’re using something that you didn’t need to pay for, getting help can be quite a challenge. Fortunately, Python has a large following and is heavily used in academic and industrial circles, which means that there are plenty of useful analytics libraries available. Python users needing help can always turn to Stack Overflow, mailing lists, and user-contributed code and documentation. And the more popular Python becomes, the more users will contribute information on their user experience, and that means more support material is available at no cost. This creates a self-perpetuating spiral of acceptance by a growing number of data analysts and data scientists. No wonder Python’s popularity is increasing!

So, to sum up, these points, Python isn’t overly complex to use, the price is right (free!), and there’s enough support out there to make sure that you won’t be brought to a screeching halt if an issue arises. That means that this is one of those rare cases where “you get what you pay for” most certainly does not apply!
